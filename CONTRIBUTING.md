- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what behavior you expected
- **Include PHP version** and any relevant environment details
- **Include code samples** that demonstrate the issue

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate how it would be used
- **Describe the current behavior** and explain why the enhancement would be useful
- **List any alternative solutions** you've considered

### Contributing Code

#### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention
- Issues labeled `documentation` - improvements or additions to documentation

#### Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages

3. Add or update tests as needed

4. Ensure all tests pass and code standards are met:
   ```bash
   composer check
   ```

5. Push your branch and submit a pull request

## Development Process

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` - Improving structure/format of the code
  - ‚ö° `:zap:` - Improving performance
  - üêõ `:bug:` - Fixing a bug
  - üìù `:memo:` - Writing docs
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` - Adding tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` - Changing configuration files

## Style Guidelines

### PHP Style

This project follows PSR-12 coding standards. Before submitting a pull request:

1. Run PHP CodeSniffer to check for style violations:
   ```bash
   composer cs-check
   ```

2. Fix any style violations automatically where possible:
   ```bash
   composer cs-fix
   ```

3. Run PHPStan for static analysis:
   ```bash
   composer analyse
   ```

### Code Principles

- **Write clear, self-documenting code** - Code should be readable without extensive comments
- **Follow SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, open-closed, etc.
- **Add PHPDoc blocks** for all public methods and complex logic
- **Use type declarations** for parameters and return types
- **Maintain backward compatibility** when possible

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
- Use descriptive test method names that explain what is being tested
- Aim for high code coverage but prioritize meaningful tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage report
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/YourTestFile.php

# Run tests in a specific group
vendor/bin/phpunit --group your-group
```

### Performance Testing

If your changes might affect performance:

1. Run benchmarks before and after your changes:
   ```bash
   composer bench
   ```

2. Include benchmark results in your pull request description

3. Consider adding new benchmarks for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure all tests pass** and code standards are met
2. **Update the README.md** with details of changes if applicable
3. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** following the existing format
4. **Increase version numbers** if applicable (we use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/))
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
7. **Squash commits** if requested before merging
