In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissive or disrespectful comments about pull requests or issues

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers should:

* Lead by example in demonstrating inclusive and respectful behavior
* Address reported incidents promptly and fairly
* Respect the privacy and security of incident reporters
* Seek to understand different perspectives before taking action
* Document significant incidents and actions taken

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to project repositories
* Participating in project discussions on GitHub, forums, or chat platforms

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported using any of the following methods:

* **GitHub Issues**: Open a private security advisory in the repository

* **Discussion Forum**: Use the private reporting feature in GitHub Discussions

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. We will not publicly discuss reports or actions taken unless absolutely necessary for community safety.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting an incident, please provide:
* Your contact information (for follow-up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of individuals involved
* Description of the incident, including relevant links/screenshots
* Date and time of the incident
* Any additional context or information that may be helpful

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

### Enforcement Process

1. **Report Receipt**: All reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: The project team will investigate the incident

4. **Action**: Appropriate action will be taken, which may include:
   - Warning the offender

   - Permanent ban from project spaces
   - Reporting to GitHub for platform-level action
5. **Follow-up**: The reporter will be informed of the outcome

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
